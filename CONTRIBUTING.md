### Suggesting Features

1. Check [Issues](https://github.com/atilladeniz/Kubeli/issues) for existing feature requests
2. Create a new issue using the Feature Request template
3. Describe the problem and proposed solution clearly

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Write meaningful commit messages
   - Add tests if applicable

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   make lint      # Run linter

   Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

**TypeScript/React (Frontend)**
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow existing patterns in `src/components`
- Use Zustand for state management
- Use the existing UI components from `src/components/ui`

**Rust (Backend)**
- Follow Rust conventions
- Use `cargo fmt` for formatting
- Use `cargo clippy` for linting
- Handle errors properly with Result types

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
- `feat: add helm release deletion`
- `fix: resolve port forward connection issue`
- `docs: update README with new features`
- `refactor: simplify cluster connection logic`

### Testing

- Test on macOS with Apple Silicon
- Test with at least one Kubernetes cluster (Minikube is fine)
- Verify both light and dark themes work

## Building for Production

```bash
# Build the app
make build

# The DMG will be in src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/
```
