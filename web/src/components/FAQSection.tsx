    question: "What makes Kubeli different from Lens?",
    answer: "Kubeli is a native desktop app built with Tauri and Rust - not Electron like Lens. This means significantly lower memory usage (~100MB vs ~350MB), faster startup, and better OS integration. Plus: Kubeli is 100% open source and free."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Kubeli an Electron app?",
    answer: "No! Kubeli uses Tauri 2.0 with a Rust backend. This makes the app about 10x smaller than comparable Electron apps and much more resource-efficient. The native webview integration provides a true native experience on macOS, Windows, and Linux."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the AI assistant work?",
    answer: "Kubeli integrates with Claude Code CLI and OpenAI Codex CLI. You can analyze logs, get troubleshooting help, and request cluster insights in natural language. The AI runs locally - no cluster data is sent to the cloud."
  },
  {
    question: "Which Kubernetes versions are supported?",
    answer: "Kubeli supports all current Kubernetes versions through k8s-openapi v1.32. This includes local clusters (Minikube, kind, Docker Desktop) as well as cloud providers like GKE, EKS, and AKS."
  },
  {
    question: "Which platforms are supported?",
    answer: "Kubeli runs natively on macOS (10.15+), Windows (10/11), and Linux (x64 AppImage). All platforms support auto-updates, so you'll always have the latest features and security fixes."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my cluster data secure?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Kubeli processes all data locally on your machine. There's no cloud connection, no telemetry, no data collection. Your kubeconfig stays on your device."
